/**
 * The reader of the multipart rule: packages from events.
 *
 * A protocol opts an event name N into the rule for its contracts. For every configured
 * (contract, N) pair the reader:
 *
 * 1. takes only `Misc` events of that contract whose name is exactly N (after restoring
 *    the 32-byte name and the 256-byte payload the ledger trims); every other event is
 *    left untouched;
 * 2. groups them by (network, contract, N, transaction, physical segment): one group is
 *    one package, the events one contract emitted from one intent;
 * 3. orders each group by the events' position (the raw action index, or an event id
 *    that follows ledger emission order), never by delivery order;
 * 4. tolerates an identical redelivery of one identity (same group and position) and
 *    rejects the package when one identity arrives with two contents;
 * 5. returns each package's merged payload: the concatenation of its 256-byte payloads.
 *
 * It never interprets the merged payload: that is the adopting protocol's processing.
 * It cannot tell whether it saw every event of an intent: a paging source must fetch
 * all of them first, and the placement check against the raw transaction detects a
 * missing part.
 *
