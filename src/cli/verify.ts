/**
 * Wallet-free verification of packages of the multipart rule, for one configured
 * (contract, event name N) and its emitting circuit, in three levels:
 *
 * - Level 1, the package: the contract's `Misc` events named N, grouped per intent
 *   (transaction and physical segment), ordered by ledger emission order, widths
 *   restored and merged. From the indexer the source is each event's raw ledger bytes
 *   (they carry the intent); offline it is the saved raw transaction.
 * - Level 2, the placement, from the raw transaction bytes: the transaction is
 *   included (`SUCCESS` or `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`) and the bytes hash to it; every call of
 *   the emitting circuit of the contract in the package's intent is guaranteed-only,
 *   and those calls log exactly the package's parts, in order; the raw bytes show no
 *   package the events lack. With a node, the node's block must also hold the bytes.
 * - Level 3, the code: the verifier key the contract stored for the emitting circuit,
 *   at the transaction's block, equals the expected (committed) key.
 *
 * Proofs are not re-verified: inclusion means the network verified them.
 *
 * Without a transaction hash every package of the (contract, N) is listed, from the
 * contract's events (`contractEvents(filter: { contractAddress, types: [MISC] })`,
 * paged: the indexer has no name filter), and each is verified to the requested level.
